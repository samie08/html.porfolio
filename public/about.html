<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Samuel Obaseki, a Front-End Web Developer from Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. I have a strong passion for technology and creativity, which led me to pursue a career in web development. Although I graduated from the University of Benin with a degree in International Studies and Diplomacy, I discovered my true calling in tech. I enjoy building user-friendly and visually engaging websites that offer seamless user experiences.</p>
<p>I come from a Catholic family and am the fourth of five children. My faith has been an important part of my life, and I even had the privilege of serving as an altar boy during my younger years. These experiences have helped shape my values and work ethic.</p>
<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy a variety of activities, including playing video games, watching movies, hitting the gym, and playing football. I’m always looking for new things to learn and love staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology. For me, learning is a lifelong journey, and I’m excited to see where this path will take me</p>
